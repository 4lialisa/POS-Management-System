# 🧾 Point of Sales (POS) Management System

## 📘 Overview
The **Point of Sales (POS) Management System** is a Java-based application developed to automate retail transactions, streamline cashier operations, and improve inventory management in a supermarket or retail setting.  
It caters to both **cashiers** and **administrators**, providing secure login, product management, transaction tracking, and real-time sales processing with receipt generation.

This project was developed as part of **Object-Oriented Programming (TOP2121)** course.

## 🎯 Objectives
The main goal is to design a robust POS system that goes beyond traditional cash registers by integrating:
- ⚙️ Efficient transaction processing  
- 📦 Product and inventory management  
- 👥 Cashier registration and management  
- 💳 Multi-payment options  
- 🧾 Receipt and transaction history generation  

### System Goals:
- Develop a **user-friendly GUI** for both cashier and admin users.
- Implement **secure authentication** using encrypted passwords.
- Support **product creation, deletion, and editing** for administrators.
- Automate **sales, payment, and receipt generation**.
- Store all transaction data in text files for easy management and persistence.

## 🧩 Program Scope
The POS Management System supports two user roles:

### 👩‍💼 Cashier
- Secure login using encrypted password authentication  
- Display list of available products  
- Process product sales and calculate total payment  
- Generate detailed receipt with product info, date, time, and payment method  
- Limited access to system settings and admin features  

### 🧑‍💼 Admin
- Secure login with unique credentials  
- Register, edit, and delete cashier accounts  
- Manage product inventory (add, update, delete products)  
- Process and record sales transactions  
- View complete **transaction history**  

---

## 🧠 Problem Statements
Traditional POS systems often fail to address modern retail challenges such as:
- ❌ Limited functionality for inventory and cashier management  
- ❌ Manual and error-prone sales tracking  
- ❌ Inflexible payment methods (cash only)  
- ❌ Complex employee training and data handling  

This system resolves these issues with automation, real-time data access, and a simplified graphical interface.
